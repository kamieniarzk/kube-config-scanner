    [CRITICAL] Container Ephemeral Storage Request and Limit
        · csi-driver-registrar -> Ephemeral Storage limit is not set

    [CRITICAL] Pod NetworkPolicy
        · The pod does not have a matching NetworkPolicy
            Create a NetworkPolicy that targets this pod to control who/what
            can communicate with this pod. Note, this feature needs to be
            supported by the CNI implementation used in the Kubernetes cluster
            to have an effect.
    [CRITICAL] Container Resources
        · csi-driver-registrar -> CPU limit is not set

    [CRITICAL] Container Security Context Privileged
        · gce-pd-driver -> The container is privileged
            Set securityContext.privileged to false. Privileged containers can
            access all devices on the host, and grants almost the same access as
            non-containerized processes on the host.

    [WARNING] Service Type
        · The service is of type NodePort
            NodePort services should be avoided as they are insecure, and can
            not be used together with NetworkPolicies. LoadBalancers or use of
            an Ingress is recommended over NodePorts.
