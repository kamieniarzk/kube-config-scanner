    [CRITICAL] Container Image Pull Policy
        · kube-bench -> ImagePullPolicy is not set to Always
            It's recommended to always set the ImagePullPolicy to Always, to
            make sure that the imagePullSecrets are always correct, and to
            always get the image you want.
    [CRITICAL] Pod NetworkPolicy
        · The pod does not have a matching NetworkPolicy
            Create a NetworkPolicy that targets this pod to control who/what
            can communicate with this pod. Note, this feature needs to be
            supported by the CNI implementation used in the Kubernetes cluster
            to have an effect.
    [CRITICAL] Pod Probes
        · Container is missing a readinessProbe
            A readinessProbe should be used to indicate when the service is
            ready to receive traffic. Without it, the Pod is risking to receive
            traffic before it has booted. It's also used during rollouts, and
            can prevent downtime if a new version of the application is failing.
